      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Congratulations on being accepted as a Bruin Club Campus Tour Guide!</p>
      <p>The purpose of the tour is to give prospective students and their families the information that they need to make a decision about Brown. You aren't trying to get everyone on your tour to LOVE Brown - you just want to help them get to know the school better. Remember, this might be their first and only time coming to Brown! So your tour can make a huge difference in helping them decide. Stay positive, make it personal, and have fun!</p>

      <section id="day-of">
        <h3>Day of</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tours are given Monday-Friday at 9 am, 11 am, 1 pm, and 3 pm as well as select Saturdays in the fall at 11 am, 12 pm, and 1 pm.</li>
          <li>Tours begin at the Welcome Center of the Stephen Robert ’62 Campus Center in Faunce House, but remember that you will need to pick up visitors from Information Sessions for the 11 am and 3 pm tours.  Information sessions are held Monday through Friday at 10:15 am and 2:15 pm as well as Saturdays at 10:15 am and 11:15 am. If you are giving the 9 am or 1 pm tour during the week or the 10 am tour on Saturday, remember that you must end the tour on time so that visitors may attend the information sessions.</li>
          <li>Tours should be 1 hour long at most. The time limit exists to avoid disrupting the Admission Office’s Information Session schedule. Even if the tour starts late, be sure to end the tour on time.</li>
          <li>Tour guides must sign into the computer next to the front desk to verify attendance 10 minutes before your tour begins. If you know you may run late let your mentor guide know in advance. If you are not able to be at your tour slot, it is your responsibility to find a replacement.</li>
          <li>There is no dress code for tours, but please look professional. Please do not wear sunglasses and hats. Leggings, clothing from other universities, chewing gum and smoking are all a no-go.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="liability">
        <h3>Liability</h3>
        <ul >
          <li>If you do not know something, offer to direct them to the proper resource at the end of the tour.</li>
          <li>Don't compare Brown to other schools, especially the other Ivies. Also, do not give out average GPAs, SAT scores, or other stats that can interpreted as guaranteeing acceptance. Remind visitors that statistics can be found on Brown’s website.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="accessibility">
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <ul >
          <li>If any tour in a given time slot contains a visitor who has requested the wheelchair accessible tour, all tours in that time slot must provide the accessible tour, even those groups that do not contain a visitor who has requested the wheelchair accessible tour. This is to prevent visitors from feeling excluded, and failure to abide by this procedure will result in job termination.</li>
          <li>A map is available at the Information Desk of all accessible buildings on campus. This map also details the routes through campus that avoid stairs and other obstacles. In most cases, the Admission Office will have been informed previously about accessibility issues and will have made special arrangements.</li>
          <li>The Handicap Accessible Route Tour is the same as the regular tour, with one exception: instead of entering Sayles Hall, walk to the right of it to enter Simmons Quad.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="mentor-guides">
        <h3>Mentor Guides</h3>
        <ul>

          <li>Please contact your mentor guide if you are unable to find a substitute or if you are unable to give a tour.</li>
          <li>Mentor guides are expected to shadow each new guide on their slot before the new guide gives his/her first solo tour.</li>
          <li>If the tour slot falls before an info session, mentor guides are expected to let the information session leader know how many groups go out on a given day.</li>
          <li>Mentor guides must report any absences, substitutions or general problems on their slot.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="substitution-policy">
        <h3>Substitution Policy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If you know about a future conflict more than a week in advance email the tour coordinators and let them know.</li>
          <li>Text SUB MM/DD to TourTime. Do this a week before the tour for which you need a sub. Contact the coordinators if you find a cover.</li>
          <li>If, 3 DAYS before your tour, you still have not found a sub, send out a request to the full listserv. Contact the coordinators if you find a cover.</li>

        <h3>Quiet Green</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Brown University, the seventh oldest college in America, was founded in 1764 is Warren, Rhode Island as Rhode Island College.
          </li>
          <li> Brown was one of the first colleges in the nation to admit students regardless of their religious affiliation.</li>
          <li>In 1770, Rhode Island College was moved to Providence, and work began on the first building, The College Edifice, which has been known as University Hall since 1822.</li>
          <li>In 1804, Nicholas Brown, son of the founders of The College and member of the class of 1786, donated the sum of $5000 to The College.  In recognition of his generosity, The College’s name was changed to Brown University.</li>

        <h3>John Hay Library (1910)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The John Hay Library is one of seven libraries on campus, and is one of the three “sacred libraries.”  (The John Carter Brown Library and the Ann-Mary Brown Memorial complete the trio).  It is called sacred because it holds some very impressive collections, including the third largest collection of American sheet music, rare book collections of Walt Whitman, Edgar Allen Poe, T.S. Eliot, William Shakespeare, and Abraham Lincoln.  The John Hay also houses the world’s largest collection of comic books, of tin toy soldiers (over 5,000), and of American poetry and plays.</li>
          <li>John Audubon’s Birds of America (double elephant folio) is a premier piece of 19th century natural history.  The pictures of the birds are hand drawn, life-size, and on display on the first floor of the library.  Every month, the page is flipped to a new drawing.</li>
          <li>Arrangement of dried flowers used during the funeral of Abraham Lincoln, handwritten correspondence from Lincoln, the death mask of Napoleon, and the life mask of Abraham Lincoln are also in the Hay.</li>

        <h3>John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library (1964)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>This is the primary humanities and social sciences library, and holds 1.5 million of Brown’s 4.3 million volumes.  Remind visitors that this does not mean that science-minded students are not welcome, but that the volumes housed in the library are geared toward the humanities.</li>  
          <li>Public computer clusters are available for student use, as well as laptop stations with Ethernet ports for students to use their own computers.   You can also rent a laptop for three hours at a time, use the self-service photocopiers, and take advantage of the scanning station.
          </li>
          <li>New to the Rock in Fall 2012 is the Digital Scholarship Lab. This unique space on campus features a 7x16 foot video wall display comprised of twelve 55 inch high resolution LED screens for large scale visualization. The lab provides software and equipment for experimentation with data of all kinds (text, images, video, audio, geospatial, etc.) and can accommodate up to 24 users at one time.</li>

        <h3>The Van Wickle Gates</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The Van Wickle Gates were built in 1901 and became the symbol of Brown.  They appear on stationery, the application, etc.</li>
          <li>Augustus Stout Van Wickle (class of 1876) died in a skeet shooting accident and left money to Brown for the gates</li>
          <li>The center gates are opened only twice each year.  During Convocation in the fall, the gates are opened inward and the entire freshman class marches from College Street to the Main Green.  The path is lined by faculty members and upper class students who applaud as the freshman walk in.  This is a memorable way to begin your Brown career.  During Commencement, the gates open outward and the graduating class files from the Main Green down College Street (into oncoming traffic...), marking their official entrance into the world.</li>

          <li>The List Art Building (1971) houses the Departments of Art and History of Art in addition to the Art Slide Library and the David Winton Bell Gallery located on the ground floor.The Gallery is Brown University’s home for contemporary art. Each year, the gallery organizes four to five major exhibitions that highlight the work of emerging talent and leading contemporary artists of all media. The gallery also hosts an annual juried student exhibition that all students may apply to. In conjunction with its exhibition program the gallery regularly programs openings, artist talks, symposia, and performances with exceptional voices in the arts. The Bell Gallery is also dedicated to preserving its permanent teaching collection of over 6000 objects, dating from the 16th century to the present. The collection is always available to students for private viewing by appointment.</li>
          <li>Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) is one of the world’s preeminent art and design schools.  It has specialized art and art history classes that are not offered at Brown.  Fortunately, Brown has a cross-registration program for up to four courses over four years.  There is also a dual degree program where students can graduate from both Brown and RISD in 5 years.  Brown students can use the RISD museum, the RISD student shuttle, and other RISD facilities with the Brown ID card.</li>
          <li>Brown’s School of Public Health is located just two blocks down from the College Green.</li>

          <li>Providence Train Station – Only a 10 minute walk from campus, the station serves both Amtrak and the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) commuter rail trains.  The commuter rail trains to Boston take about an hour and make local stops along the way, and cost only $10.00 one way!

          <li>Robinson Hall (1878) houses the Economics Department, but it was the main university library until the completion of the John Hay in 1910.  It has beautiful stained glass windows!</li>
          <li>Prospect House (1850) contains the Political Science Department, but it was a university dorm at one point.</li>
          <li>Carrie Bell Tower (1904) is 95 feet high, and it used to hold the university bell.  The bell used to ring out on only two very special occasions: in recognition of either major world event or whenever Brown won a football game—both events were said to be equally rare!  (Brown’s football team won the 2005 Ivy League championship and had a share of it in 2008, though)!  The bell has since gone missing; no historian has been able to find evidence of what happened to it even to this day.</li>

        <h3>Main Green</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Faunce houses the Student Activities Office (SAO), the central authority over all student organizations.  Brown has over 300 recognized student groups, ranging from typical clubs, like campus publications and political organizations, to more unusual clubs, like the Hawaii Club (for students from warm climates) to ARRR!!! (Brown’s aca-pirate acappella group).  Forming a student organization is as easy as writing a constitution and having 10 friends join.  If approved, a new organization is eligible for funding within one semester.</li>
          <li>Salomon Hall was originally Rogers Hall prior to renovations and additions that were completed in 1989 that added a 500 plus seat lecture hall (the largest on campus). The large lecture hall is often used for popular guest lectures given by internationally known figures, such as Barack Obama, Maya Angelou, Salman Rushdie, Mikhail Gorbachev, Martin Scorsese, Anderson Cooper, Bill Russell, Chris Berman, Sanjay Gupta, and Rob Cordry (from the Daily Show), John Krasinski, Pervez Musharraf, etc.</li>
          <li>Wilson Hall (1890) houses classrooms which are used mostly for small classes like language classes or recitation sessions.  The building does not lock until very late at night, so Wilson is a popular meeting place for extracurricular clubs and activities.  Improvements to the building’s exterior were recently completed in the summer of 2007.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Sayles Hall (1881) is one of Brown’s largest enclosed multipurpose spaces. The hall can seat 650 people and is often used for guest lectures.  The portraits on the wall are past presidents, friends, and benefactors of the university.</li>
          <li>The orchestra, founded in 1918, performs in Sayles.  Conductor Paul Phillips has been with the orchestra for 22 years.  The orchestra consists of about 100 student musicians from Brown and RISD, and in 2007 became one of the first US collegiate orchestras to tour China.</li>
          <li>Finally, Brown has fourteen active a capella groups.  These groups range from traditional male, female, and coed groups to a whistling choir and a pirate a cappella group called “ARRR,” which is dedicated to the singing of sea shanties in a style that they term “a capirate" and an all varsity athlete group known as "Jockappella"</li>

          <li>All freshmen live in a double in a first-year residence hall and are generally clustered in either Keeney or Pembroke (large community).</li>
          <li>Explain the unit system (small community).  A unit is a group of 40-60 students living in the same general location and sharing 3-4 counselors.  Talk about the different counselors—the Residential Counselor, the Minority Peer Counselor, and the Women’s Peer Counselor.  Be sure to mention that the counselors are undergraduates that serve as advisors, resources, and friends.  They plan activities for the unit and build community throughout the year.  They are not police!</li>
          <li>Over the summer, incoming students receive a questionnaire with questions about living habits and preferences, but roommates are randomly paired.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>The Sciences Library (1971) is the primary sciences library on campus. It has been voted multiple times as the ugliest building in Providence. It is fourteen stories tall, and each floor is color coded by the pH scale (the joke goes that the books get more basic as you go up).  The mezzanine level is home to a public computing cluster.</li>
          <li>The Thomas J. Watson Sr. Center for Information Technology (1988) is currently considered one of the premier computing facilities on any campus in the world.  Brown’s Computer Science Department is widely respected for its accomplishments in the field of computer science. Feel free to highlight Andy Van Dam and CS15 as an intro course taught by a world-renowned professor. He is insistent on not being the namesake for Andy in Toy Story.</li>
          <li>The Brown Design Workshop: a flexible, collaborative workspace opened to encourage deeper involvement in both the creative and technical aspects of designing and building. The Workshop space is designed to allow students to pursue projects, both academic and personal, with the freedom to rapidly prototype and build.

        <h3>Soldier’s Arch</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Soldiers’ Memorial Arch (1921) is the memorial to the 42 Brown men who died in World War I.  The myth goes that if you kiss your lover underneath it at midnight, you will get married.  The myth does not specify, however, who you will marry—a rather important part!</li>

        <h3>Waterman &amp; "The Walk"</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The Perry and Marty Granoff Center for the Creative Arts officially opened in February 2011.  The interdisciplinary arts center will foster innovation, research, collaboration, creativity, and education among the arts, humanities, and sciences.  The building is dedicated to encourage faculty and students to create bold new directions for research, teaching, and production across boundaries of individual art disciplines and among artists, scientists, and scholars.</li>
          <li>The building’s design helps foster this collaboration and innovation since it is comprised of two offset towers and almost all walls are made of glass.  This allows students working in one room to see what is happening in multiple other rooms in the building and to glean inspiration from them.</li>
          <li>Urban Environmental Lab and Garden.  The goal of the center and the garden is to focus on sustainable living techniques and urban self-sufficiency.  There is another garden on Hope Street run by the Sustainable Food Initiative.</li>

        <h3>After the Tour</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Try to stay behind for a few minutes after the tour to talk to the visitors and answer any lingering questions.  It is a nice touch to give visitors your email address and invite them to email you with additional questions, but this is not required.  Remember to mention that people can browse the Brown website for additional information.</li>

        <h3>Conversation Starters:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Before the tour begins, please take some time to get acquainted with the prospective students and their families. Try to find out about their specific interests in order to make the tour as helpful as possible. An easy way to break the ice is to ask the group who traveled the farthest to get to Brown or who lives the closest to Brown.</li>
          <li>Always look for questions.  People are often embarrassed to speak in front of a large group, so always look for questions in the group.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="public-speaking">
        <h3>Public Speaking:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Speak confidently and be sure to project your voice over the crowd — it’s easy to forget about the stragglers at the back of the tour. Don't talk while walking, instead allow your group to assemble around you when you reach a new spot before you begin talking so that everyone can hear you.</li>
          <li>Don't be a robot! Always try to be enthusiastic and do your best to make each tour personal and unique.</li>
          <li>Please avoid using acronyms, abbreviations, or Brown Slang. Remember these people don't go here! (Yet!)</li>
          <li>Bring a drink with you whether that be water, coffee, juice, etc. Its a nice way to keep from getting a sore throat and can make pauses in speech less awkward. Plus if it’s caffeinated you come off extra excited!</li>
